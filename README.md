# Ladybug
This is a repo for AI Python integration.

This is the repo for future use of this
project which has yet to be defined as to what I will be 
doing with.

### Potential Idea:
Maybe have an animation where we can generate an image that the ladybug can fly across as it answers the questions?
Pixel-ize the response on the bottom, kind of like UnderTale type aesthetic 
on a website?

For now this will be the playground to my horrendous ideas.


### Settled and Decided upon Idea(Truly a basic, horrendous idea for my poor coding skills) 



```
    So essentially what I want to do is have the user input a question they have and basically have the Gemini AI to generate a image and the answer that we can display to the screen in a pixelated style format which will be done sort of like UnderTale. Have a stylized ladybug that flys across the screen.
```

### Decision:
```
    I have decided to create essentially a desktop pet except with more character and AI functionality. Possibly some animations for the pet to ask if the user wants to see a trick.
```
