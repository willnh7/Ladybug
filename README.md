# Ladybug
This is a repo for AI Python integration.

This is the repo for future use of this
project which has yet to be defined as to what I will be 
doing with.

# Potential Idea:
Have the ladybug give only facts about bugs or maybe just have a website of a ladybug that spits out
chatgpt answers?



Maybe have an animation where we can generate an image that the ladybug can fly across as it answers the questions?
Pixel-ize the response on the bottom, kind of like UnderTale type aesthetic 
on a website?

For now this will be the playground to my horrendous ideas.
