## The Leaf python file will be mainly about somehow integrating 
# the chatgpt ai api into an essentially console terminal prompting.


Pseudocode {
    Output a prompt for the user to input a question 
    Read in string from console for the prompt 
    output response from ai to console,
    ask again





    do {
        output to console for the user to ask a question
        read in user input as string  then plug into chatgpt 
        output the response from ai 
    } while(user wants another response)






}
